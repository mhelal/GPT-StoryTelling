      "For example, when you see a red ball, your eye is activated, and this ball is passed as input to other neurons.\n",

      "Every neuron tries to understand and keep activating other neurons (maybe a memory of other images you saw before) to learn the image's description.\n",
      "\n",
      "One neuron can be activated by one input or more. The neuron outputs one or more outputs to activate another one more neuron. Maybe you saw a lion and must activate your legs to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to understand what you saw; your neurons divide any scene into partitions and label each.\n",
      "\n",
      "All labels/descriptions of the scene partitions in one neuron decide its one or more outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your brain decides the scene contents by weighing these inputs and outputs with your prior knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer from one neuron is sent to another neuron or more.\n",

      "Many neurons talk to many neurons in your body to see, move, talk, learn and everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "From 2013, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) now remember people's faces and label them with their names, as well as many animals and objects around us.\n",

      "Computers are now trained on so many human faces that they can generate new faces that do not exist around us.\n",

      "\n",
      "1      Misinformation and Fake Content              Generative AI can be used to create fake news, images, and videos that can mislead people and spread misinformation.\n",

      "2      Privacy and Data Protection            Generating AI may require large datasets, raising concerns about data privacy and consent, especially when using personal data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3     Bias and Discrimination        If the training data used is biased, generative AI can produce discriminatory outputs, perpetuating existing societal biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4     Intellectual Property                 There are challenges in determining ownership rights to AI-generated content and the potential infringement of existing copyrights.\n",
      "\n",
      "5      Security and Malicious Use               Generative AI can be exploited for malicious purposes like creating deepfake videos for fraud or cyberattacks.\n",

      "6        Regulation and Accountability            There is a need for regulations to govern the use of generative AI and to hold individuals and organizations accountable for its ethical and legal implications.\n",
