Imagine an illustrated children's story book featuring an 8-year-old girl who is caught in a dilemma. She is trying to decide whether she wants to follow the path of her grandmother, a prominent ecologist, or whether she wants to pursue a career as a medical doctor or an engineer. She sits in her room, surrounded by textbooks and notes, her eyes reflecting her inner struggle. The room is a mix of lush green plants, a nod to her grandmother's profession, medical equipment and engineering tools. Portray this scene in a colorful, friendly, and engaging style, suitable for a children's book.
