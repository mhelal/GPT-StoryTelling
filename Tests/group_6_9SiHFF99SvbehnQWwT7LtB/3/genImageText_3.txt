A vivid scene of a group of superheroes in a university setting, they are engaged in their geography class. These superheroes come from diverse backgrounds, for example, one of them is a Black female, another is a Hispanic male, and the third is a Caucasian non-binary individual. They're immersed in their studies, learning intricate details about the planet. Some are pouring over large, detailed maps while others are conducting deep research on their laptops. They are all working diligently on their graduation projects. In the corner of the room, a generative AI assistant is displaying relevant geographical data on a digital screen. The AI helper is designed to aid the superheroes in their research projects, making their task relatively easier and more efficient.
