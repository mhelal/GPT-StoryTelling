In the early morning, the superhero starts the day with generative AI and plans a healthy breakfast before heading to school to engage with teachers and classmates. Using AI, the superhero efficiently learns history, becomes human-in-the-loop in reinforcement learning, and studies ancient civilizations. As the superhero progresses to university, they delve deeper into historical studies, including comparative analyses and proposing a historical question for a PhD topic. Meanwhile, a primary school girl superhero explores geography using generative AI ethically and effectively to enhance learning and answer questions, from school assignments to graduation projects and even a potential PhD in geography.
