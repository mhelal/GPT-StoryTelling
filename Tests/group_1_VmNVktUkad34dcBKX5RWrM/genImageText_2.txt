An illustrative scene from a children's storybook, where superheroes are engaged in offering personalised spiritual advice. One of the superheroes, cloaked in flowing robes, holds an Islamic book in his hand, symbolising the Muslim beliefs and needs. The superhero is explaining from the book, demonstrating openness and respect to diverse religious faiths. He is Middle-Eastern in descent, but the image also shows a diverse range of other superheroes listening attentively, capturing a broad spectrum of gender and ethnicity. The scene evokes peace, understanding, and mutual respect.
