Imagine a scene from a children's storybook where a young superhero is in a university setting. He is deeply engrossed in studying history, spanning across various eras, starting from the ancient times all the way to the contemporary era. His focus lies in performing comparative studies. There are stacks of books around him and historical timelines are visible on the walls. His distinctive cape and superhero insignia are somewhat subdued to blend in with the academic environment, but still recognizable. His eyes filled with determination and curiosity, ready to use this knowledge to better the world.
