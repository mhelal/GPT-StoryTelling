In the first lesson, the superhero dives into the ocean to explore various organisms like colorful fish, coral reefs, and mysterious sea creatures. Each organism has unique characteristics that fascinate the superhero, sparking a curiosity for marine life.
At high school, the superhero can focus on biology, environmental science, and computer programming to prepare for university studies in marine biology. These subjects will provide a solid foundation to understand ocean ecosystems and work alongside generative AI in research and exploration.
