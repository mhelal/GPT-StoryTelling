Create an engaging and educational image for a children's story book. This image should depict the first lesson about life under the ocean. Show different organisms that live beneath the water surface and exhibit their characteristics distinctly. Include a variety of oceanic creatures like a Caucasian mermaid with her vibrant orange fish tail, a large, aged sea turtle, a school of shimmering silver fish swimming together, a Hispanic diver, a friendly giant octopus with jelly-like tentacles, and a cluster of colorful coral reefs. The background should represent the deep blue sea filled with mystic and beauty.
