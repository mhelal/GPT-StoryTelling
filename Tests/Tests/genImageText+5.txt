Imagine an illustrated page from a children's story book. In the center, a superhero of South Asian descent, dressed in vibrant colors with a pair of glasses perched on their nose, stands in an academic lounge. They are gesturing to a chalkboard filled with complex equations and diagrams related to a cutting-edge PhD topic in quantum physics - a recent advance like quantum entanglement or string theory. The superhero has a focused expression, indicating they are passionately proposing their topic to unseen listeners. Surrounding the scene are bookcases full of research papers and scientific journals, paintings of historical inventors, and cozy reading chairs.
