An illustration of a storybook named 'Donna'. The cover should be colorful and inviting, filled with enchanting elements common in children's literature like trees, cute animals, and a path leading to an unknown adventure. Centered text should articulate the title 'Donna', written in playful, large-print font. The overall design should engage a young reader's curiosity and imagination.
